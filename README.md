# Sample Project 1 - Selenium Test Automation

### ðŸ“– Project Description

This is a sample Selenium Test Automation framework designed to automate browser testing for web applications using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Java** and **TestNG**. The framework supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge) and utilizes Maven for dependency management.

## ðŸ”¥ Important Update (March 2025)

### SeleniumManager Compatibility Issue
If you encounter errors like:
```WARNING: There was an error managing chromedriver... session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 132```

This is caused by a mismatch between **ChromeDriver** and your **Chrome browser version**. SeleniumManager may fail to download the correct driver if:

- Your browser updated to a newer version.
- Network issues prevent driver downloads.

---

### âœ… The Fix
Add the following line to your `BrowserManager` class:
```java
System.setProperty("webdriver.http.factory", "jdk-http-client");
```

### ðŸ“Œ Why This Fix Works

- It forces Selenium to use Java's built-in HTTP client (jdk-http-client) for managing driver downloads.

- Ensures compatibility with SeleniumManager (Selenium 4.6.0 and later).

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Tips

- Clear your driver cache and try again.

- If SeleniumManager fails, you can use WebDriverManager (Bonigarcia) as a fallback.
